# ST Syntax Highlighting for Git Interactive Rebase

**This was made specifically for Sublime Text 2**

## Installation

### Using Package Control in Sublime Text 2/3

Package control is a package manager for Sublime Text extensions (think of it like "apt-get" for Sublime Text). If you haven't already, install [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation) into your instance of Sublime Text and restart. Choose **Package Controll: Install Package** (press `Ctrl/Cmd + p` and then type `pi`), search for package named `Git Interactive Rebase` and install.  Restart if you cannot select "Git Interactive Rebase" from syntax highlighter menu.

### Sublime Text manual installation

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
    git clone https://github.com/deliciousinsights/sublime-git-rebase-interactive.git "Git Interactive Rebase"

Replace '2' with '3' in case of Sublime Text 3.

Patches for additions are always welcome.
